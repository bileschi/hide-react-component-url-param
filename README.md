Illustartes how to control visibility of a react component via urlParam

Build with yarn start

```
   yarn start
```

Navigate to site

```
   http://localhost:3000
```

The site should print the word 'About' and list all the urlParams and their values.

If there is a urlParam titled 'hideabout', then you will get a secret message

```
   http://localhost:3000/#hideabout
```
